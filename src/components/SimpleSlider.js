                    <p>A quick sketch displaying the general mood that most -if not all- people are in during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
                    This was drawn after more than a year had passed since the pandemic started. As time went by, the line between work and personal life became more blurry which led to the inability to have a proper work-life balance and horrible sleep schedules. 
                    Days started to look more like each other and the motivation to do things slowly faded. Many people, myself included, are feeling this daily, weird tiredness.</p>

                    <p>A gentleman I tried to draw give a low-key Rembrandt vibe. 
                    The colors of the background, the hair, and the accessories were chosen with Rembrandtâ€™s style in mind.</p>
